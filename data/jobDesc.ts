#### 1: Full-Stack Development for Promo Code Platform

At Swapt, I built and maintained full-stack systems for a dynamic QR/promo code management platform. I created modular and reusable **React/TypeScript** components with custom hooks, consuming REST APIs to build highly responsive, mobile-friendly UIs. These components enhanced developer productivity and improved user experience across devices.

---

#### 2: Scalable Microservices with Spring Boot

On the backend, I developed **Java Spring Boot** microservices responsible for promo code generation, validation, and redemption. The architecture followed **domain-driven design** principles and included advanced error handling and workflow orchestration, which improved service reliability by over 40%.

---

#### 3: Real-Time Analytics and Optimized Database Performance

I designed optimized **PostgreSQL** schemas and implemented real-time analytics features by tuning queries with indexing, batching, and connection pooling. This enabled fast dashboard updates and campaign monitoring at scale.

---

#### 4: AI-Powered Promo Targeting Workflows

Using **Python**, **Airflow**, and **OpenAI APIs**, I automated promotional targeting workflows through agentic LLM pipelines. These agents analyzed redemption data trends and user intent to generate recommendations, reducing manual configuration by 50%.

---

#### 5: AI-Paired Development & Observability Enhancements

I leveraged **Cursor AI** for intelligent code suggestions and test case generation, which helped maintain over 85% test coverage. I also integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time service monitoring, reducing incident resolution time by 60%.

---

#### Milestones:
  - Automated campaign logic using AI agents, reducing manual rule writing.
  - Delivered responsive frontend features and reliable backend services.
  - Reduced issue resolution time with observability tooling and containerized infrastructure.

## Overview

---

I served as a **Graduate Teaching Assistant** for CS4530: Fundamentals of Software Engineering at Northeastern University under Prof. Adeel Bhutta during Spring 2024. The course involved hands-on agile software development with real-world projects.

---

#### Responsibilities:

- Mentored student teams through agile sprints, helping them with sprint planning, code reviews, and project retrospectives.
- Provided technical guidance on version control workflows, frontend/backend integration, and testing strategies.
- Evaluated submissions across project milestones: MVP delivery, additional features, unit/integration tests, and final demo/presentation.
- Maintained grading consistency using rubrics for planning, process, product delivery, and documentation.
- Assessed individual contributions via code reviews, peer evaluations, and Git commit histories to ensure fair team assessment.

---

### Key Takeaways:
  - Strengthened mentoring skills by guiding real software teams through agile development.
  - Evaluated student performance with a blend of technical and collaborative metrics.
  - Reinforced my knowledge in full-stack engineering, agile methodologies, and software delivery best practices.

#### 1: Secure Document Intake Platform

At Intuit, I engineered a secure document submission system using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **AWS S3**, exposing RESTful APIs for file validation and payment workflows. This reduced manual document processing time by 35% and ensured secure, auditable submissions.

---

#### 2: Tax Filing Dashboard with Enhanced UX

I developed a responsive tax filing dashboard using **Angular**, implementing modular components, form validation, and lazy loading to improve page load performance by 45% and enhance user experience across devices.

---

#### 3: Financial Platform Integration via Multithreading

To support real-time brokerage and crypto platform integrations, I built a multithreaded microservice using **ExecutorService** and thread pools. This enabled concurrent profit/loss computation and boosted processing throughput by 50%.

---

#### 4: Optimized SQL for High-Volume Financial Data

I designed **Oracle SQL** schemas and **PL/SQL** procedures optimized with batching, indexing, and partitioning to ensure consistent low-latency performance in high-load environments, improving query speeds by over 40%.

---

#### 5: DevOps, CI/CD, and Monitoring Enhancements

I implemented CI/CD pipelines using **Jenkins**, enforced code quality with **SonarQube**, and configured infrastructure with **Docker**, **Kubernetes (EKS)**, and **Terraform**. I also integrated **Splunk** dashboards for real-time log analysis and incident alerting.

---

#### Milestones:
  - Reduced document processing delays through secure and scalable backend APIs.
  - Improved cross-platform tax dashboard performance and usability.
  - Boosted operational throughput and reduced regression risk through CI/CD and monitoring integrations.
